      <p>Norway is one of the most beautiful places in the world. There is so much to see and you will never run out of places to Visit.
        Norway is home to over 50,000 islands. There is always a place to explore. 
      </p>
      <h2>Hikes</h2>
      <p>Norway is home to thousands of the most incredible hikes in the world! hiking is a must in Norway and it is so 
          important in their culture that they even accept hiking clothes as casual attire or even sometimes business casul. It would not
          be uncommon for a teacher to wear himself some hiking pants as he goes to work. Hikes in Norway can vary in difficulty and we want to sahre 
          some of the best ones in each area with you. Norway can be broken up into four landscapes: West, East, South, North.
      </p>
      <h2>The West</h2>
      <p>This is where you can get some great hikes in. The west is where the coast is and is home to so many hikes around fjords and other amazing views.
          The first place I'd recommend is Stavangers own Preikestolen.
          Preikestolen or "Pulpit Rock" is a wonderful all day hike that is super easy and anyone can do, The only constraint is time.
          You can get to Preikestolen by taking a ferry from Stavanger and then taking a bus up to the base. This means it should be easy for 
          anyone to go this hike. The ferry ride and bus ride total to about 30-40$ I also recommend stopping at a grocery and picking up snacks and 
          a lunch to hold a picnic at the top.  
      </p>
      <h2>The North</h2>
      <p>The north is full of so many beautiful hikes. Two of the main hotspots for tourists to hike are Lofoten and to visit Tromso.
          Tromso is the worlds capital for northern lights and you can really see thier beauty come to life at night. Just hope it isn't cloudy as Norway
          is no stranger to snow and rainy nights. The night time comes really fast and if you are there in the heart of winter you might never even see the sun.
      </p>
      <h2>The East</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the city. Norways main munipality of Oslo is in the east and there are so many meuseums to go to and also some great hikes if you are feeling
          a venture outside of the city. I recommend that if there is snow on the ground Korkatrekken is a good way to go! You can easily 
          entertain yourself as you take on one of the largest sledding hills in the world. The best part is at the buttom it ends at the subway which will
          allow you to take it straight back up to the top (Very efficient!).
